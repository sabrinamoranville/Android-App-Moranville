Application that informs user when to change a variety of filters
1.	Project Description 
The purpose of this project is to create an application that notifies the user when to replace the filters in their home, automobiles, vacuum, and others. The application will have categories of filters to select from and the date that they were installed and put to use. The start date and lifespan of the filter is selected, and the application calculates when to replace the filter and sends an alert. The application stores the filter model information so the user can easily replace it. 
2.	Problem addressing
Humans are busy! With all of our different activities and obligations, it is hard to remember everything. There are certain tasks that get put on the back burner, and replacing filters is one of those tasks. Households utilize many filters and some of them get forgotten about including dryers, vacuums, air vents, refrigerators, range hoods, gas furnaces,  humidifiers,  and air conditioning and heating systems. This application will keep track of every filter that is used, their model information, and when to replace them.
It is extremely important to replace filters. Water filters are crucial to a persons health, “They can also significantly reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disease and certain cancers, including colon cancer, bladder cancer, rectal cancer by removing chorine and byproducts from drinking water” (Stricklin, 2020). There is much awareness about the importance of quality drinking water, and it should be a priority to replace those filters on time. Replacing air filters minimizes health concerns from reducing dust and allergens in the air, and leaving old filters in for too long can cause higher energy bills and other issues with the unit. 

3.	Platform
The FriendlyFilter application will be developed using Android 7.1.1 (Nougat). This app will be created for mobile devices using Android Studio API 25. 
4.	Front/Back End Support
This application will be tested before it is published and implemented. GitHub is being used to maintain control of the application creation process and to organize progression and changes throughout development. There can be future upgrades and changes to this application to ensure compatibility and success. 
5.	Functionality 
The FriendlyFilter application will have a dashboard with a user profile that displays all their filters by category. There is a section called “Upcoming Replacements” which lists the filters that will need to be replaced in the next month. There is a tab named “Add/Update Filter” which gives the user the option to add a new one or change the date on an existing one. When a new filter is added, the user selects the current date and enters the lifespan of the filter which allows the application to monitor the replacement dates. 
6.	Design: 
The design for the FriendlyFilters application will be a simplistic design with tabs on the top and a user dashboard home screen to check their filters briefly.
